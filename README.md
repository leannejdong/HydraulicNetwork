# Hydraulic Network Library 
(under development...)

We start writing a small C++ library for solving nonlinear hydraulic network.

## Completed:
  
* Parse CSV data into integer multidimensional arrays
      
```
1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 
0 1 0 -1 0 0 0 
0 0 0 1 0 -1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 1 -1 
0 0 0 0 -1 0 1 
0 0 0 -1 1 0 0 
```

* Derive incidence matrix
    
```
1 -1 0 0 0 0 0
